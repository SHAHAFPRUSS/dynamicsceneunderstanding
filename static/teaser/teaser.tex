    Given an input image depicting a dynamic scene (left),
    our framework performs a variety of dynamic scene understanding tasks, such as human-object interactions, human-human and recognition of grounded situations, (A, B, C respectively above). Each of these predicts different entities and relations, possibly grounded in the input image (visualized as bounding boxes on the right). Our generic method contrasts with previous approaches tailored to a single such task.
